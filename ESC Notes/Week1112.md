# Week1112
### repeated code
解决方法：把重复的部分合并成一个function（一般不难看出）
### Long Method
做了太多不该做的事 解决-把不该做的事合并到单独的function里面
### Data Class&Data Clumps
前者的class只包含data结构 后者需要一个包含data结构的class
- 共同解决方法：合并成一个包含公共结构 同时也有一些responsibility（function）的class
### Shotgun Surgery
为了改一个condition需要改动很多地方
- 解决方法：把condition内容合并为一个function
### Feature Envy
If one class (A) is talking to another class (B) unusually frequent
- It is like A is doing the job of B
- In other words, A is more interested in the job of B than its own
```java

public class LiveAsCouple {
	Project[] ourProject;

	public LiveAsCouple(Project myProject, Project herProject) {
		this.ourProject[0] = myProject;
		this.ourProject[1] = herProject;
	}
	
	public Project[] getProject() {
		return this.ourProject;
	}
	
	// sudiptac: work as a team
	public void doProject() {
		workOnProject(ourProject[0]);
		workOnProject(ourProject[1]);
	}
	
	public void workOnProject(Project p) {
		//some code here
	}
}
```
### Long Message Chains
### Speculative Generality
Should avoid over engineering based on unlikely generalization
- Violates the agile development principle
- Concentrates on the features needed, throw away all other features
- The art of maximizing the “work not done”
```java
abstract class Employee {
	
	
}

//sudiptac: over-engineering, no need to create these interfaces 
// if in near future, postdocs are unlikely to teach
interface ResearchFaculty {
	
}

interface TeachingFaculty {
	
}
// over engineered code ends

//class Professor extends Employee {
class Professor extends Employee implements ResearchFaculty,TeachingFaculty{

	// Professor do research and teaching
}

//class Postdoc extends Employee {
class Postdoc extends Employee implements ResearchFaculty{

	//Postdoc do research, but does not do teaching
}

class Admin extends Employee {
	//Admins help with administrative matter
}

public class SpeculativeGeneralitySmell {

}
```
### Refused Bequest
- Inherit multitudes of unnecessary methods
```java
abstract class Employee {

}

class Professor extends Employee {

	// Professor do research, teaching, admin, outReach

  void doResearch() {

	}
  
	void doTeaching() {

	}
  
	void doAdmin() {

	}
  
	void doOutreach() {

	}
}

class Postdoc extends Professor {

	//Postdoc do research (but no teaching, admin or outreach duties)
	// inheriting from professor class is flawed as many inherited functions 
  // remain completely unused
	
	// This is refused Bequest

}

class Admin extends Employee {
	//Admins help with administrative matter
}

public class RefusedBequestSmell {

}
```
